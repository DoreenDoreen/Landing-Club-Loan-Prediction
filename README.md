Findings: 
1. The most important common feature is the annual income provided by the borrower during registration. A higher annual income is associated with a lower likelihood of the loan being charged off.

2. The second most important common feature is the interest rate on the loan. A higher interest rate increases the likelihood of the loan being charged off.

3. The third important common feature is the revolving line utilization rate, which refers to the amount of credit the borrower is using relative to their total available revolving credit.
